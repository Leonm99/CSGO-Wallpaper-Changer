## Explanation & Installation

#### How does it work?

CS:GO uses webm video files as background in the main menu.
Currently CS:GO uses 3 webm files wich are called:
```sh
sirocco.webm
```
```sh
sirocco540.webm
```
```sh
sirocco720.webm
```
For the changes to take place we only need to replace the first file without numbers. (sirocco.webm)
To change the background we simply have to create or download a webm file that we like and replace it with the currently active one, in this case **sirocco.webm**
